A **[Box Template](https://www.action.io/app#/boxes/new)** is a pre-configured development environment. Box templates usually have one primary language / framework installed and occasionally a few supporting languages installed.  We recommend when customizing your templates that you only install what is necessary for your application to run appropriately to reduce the chance of runtime or configuration errors.

[Action.IO](https://www.action.io) provides some common box templates for you to get started quickly and easily.  You can ignore the "download" or "installation" instructions on all of the Getting Started sections of these languages and platforms, we've already set everything up for you!

### Ruby / Rails

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is an open-source web framework that's optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It lets you write beautiful code by favoring convention over configuration.

### Python / Django

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level [Python](http://www.python.org/) Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

Developed by a fast-moving online-news operation, Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements of the experienced Web developers who wrote it. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.

Django focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY principle.

### Node.js

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Node is a relatively new platform, and the tutorials and posts tend to be slightly more advanced then Rails or Django.

### Go

![Golang Homepage](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/go-hp.png)

[Go](http://golang.org/) is an open source programming environment that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
