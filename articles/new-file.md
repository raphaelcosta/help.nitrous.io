#  Creating a new file

To create a new file, simply click the "+" icon to the right of the tabs in the editor portion of the Web IDE.

Note that when creating a file this way, you'll need to type the full path to the file, i.e. **app/assets/stylesheets/home.css**

To reduce the amount of typing, you can also right-click the appropriate folder in the directory tree and select "New File".

Of course, you can always use the console to create new files. If you create a file in the console

    touch app/assets/stylesheets/home.css

Then you'll need to refresh the directory tree to see updates to your project.
