If you want to just code in your browser using the web console (good for coding on the iPad), just click the "expand" icon at the right of the console header.

If you want to minimize the console, just click the same icon.

<p class="note">Remember that this is a full linux shell, so you can run emacs or vim just like you would in a native console on your machine. Give it a try!</p>
