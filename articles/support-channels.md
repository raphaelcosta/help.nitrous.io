We provide a number of ways to get in touch with someone on the Action.IO team.  If you can't find a live person in one of these channels, try another one! Our team is distributed around the globe, so odds are we're awake somewhere.  And in the rare case you can't find *anybody* you can always just [send us an email](mailto: support@action.io) and we'll do our best to respond within 24 hrs.

### Action.IO Community Q&A

We encourage you to utilize the amazing [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) community for answers to many Action.IO questions.  We also do our best to respond to any Q&A on our help forums within 2-3 days.

If you have an urgent question about stability or performance of your development box, please [send us an email](mailto: support@action.io).


### Chat Room

We have a [public campfire chatroom](https://www.action.io/chat) where many of the Action.IO employees hang out. Our team is spread out around the world, so odds are there will be somebody here to answer your question. Please don't troll the forums, that's just not cool bro.

### Live 1-on-1 Chat

We utilize the amazing [Olark](https://www.olark.com) service for 1-on-1 chat widget on our website. You can reach any of our personal employees by just clicking on the "Chat with us" tab on the bottom right-hand side of the screen.

Olark will tell us basic information about you, like your email (if you came from an invite or are logged-in) or the last page you visited, so don't freak out if we know some stuff about you, we're not north korean spies (though one of us is from korea).
