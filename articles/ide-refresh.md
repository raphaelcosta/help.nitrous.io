*Help! My file browser is not loading the directory tree in my project!*

When you launch the Web IDE, if you cannot find any of the folders in your project in the file browser, just click the refresh button at the top of the file browser.

![Directory Menu](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/filetree-refresh.png)

If you still cannot see any of the files in your file browser, try refreshing the page using your browser. Make sure you've saved any open files!!!

If it's *still* not working, send us an email at [help@action.io]("mailto:help@action.io?subject=file%20browser")
