Your N2O defines the total resources available to you on the Nitrous.IO platform.

Memory and storage each cost a specific number of N2O units, but you are free to decide whether you want to increase your Memory consumption or your Storage consumption.

This enables considerably more flexibility than the traditional "Plan" system.  Instead of being forced into a plan that doesn't quite fit your needs, you can purchase or earn more N2O and use it to upgrade your resources.

Let's look at an example.  Our free accounts get 150 units of N2O, which is enough for 384MB of Memory and 750 MB of Storage.  This is enough for a base box on Nitrous.IO (these also happen to be the lowest possible resources on any single box).

With additional N2O, you can upgrade either your Memory in 128MB units, or you Storage in 250MB units.  So if you want 1GB of Memory, but don't need the storage, you would only need to pay for the increase in Memory.

Lets say you want (2) 512MB boxes, that's easy to do as well.  Just make sure you have the N2O in your account, and you're able to increase the resources on both of your boxes.

Assuming you have enough N2O in your account, you can create (almost) any number of boxes each configured how you need them.
